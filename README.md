**Project Inspiration:**
Our project was inspired by a desire to enhance web accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities, as well as to address critical environments where traditional hardware interaction might pose health risks, such as in the presence of contagious biospecimens. Additionally, we aimed to provide a solution for the general public seeking a more convenient web browsing experience.

**Tech Stack:**
We built our project using HTML, Javascript, and incorporated WebGazer.js to enable eye-tracking functionality.

**Accessibility Focus:**
Our Chrome Extension focuses on making web interactions accessible to those with physical disabilities, ensuring a seamless browsing experience. We've also considered scenarios where hardware touch may not be suitable.

One major challenge was finding a suitable framework for implementing eye-tracking features. After exploration, we settled on WebGazer.js. Additionally, determining the optimal scroll amount, time between scrolls, and the smoothness of the scrolling was crucial. We wanted to ensure users could read without experiencing dizziness.

**Conclusion:**
Our project offers a Chrome Extension that leverages HTML, Javascript, and WebGazer.js to empower users with a unique eye-tracking control for web interactions. It not only serves individuals with physical disabilities but also caters to the broader public seeking a more intuitive browsing experience. for the disabled
